# How to Run

* Download and extract the zip file
* There are four c++ files, namely `main.cpp`, `Option.cpp`, `OptionPrice.cpp` and `UnitTest.cpp`.
* Compile the program using following command

## Compiling

```shell
g++ -o A1 -std=c++11 main.cpp Option.cpp  OptionPrice.cpp UnitTest.cpp
```

## Running the code
```shell
./A1
```

# Implementation details

## BSM model
* The values of `d1` and `d2` are calculated using the formulas given in the `IntroductiontoOptions_Sept17_19.pdf` file in the class. 
* Then we compute the value of option using the analytical formula of the Blackâ€“Scholes model (again as given in the handout)
* The standard normal function was implemented based on lab 1. It estimates the normal distribution.

## Binomial Option Pricing model
* I have set the number of levels in the tree to be a constant number 50. This was the number that 
* I first compute entire forward tree. The values of each nodes are stored so that they can be utilised later if required. 
  * The tree is stored in a `vector<vector<double>>` data structure. 
```c++
vector<vector<double>> build_tree(double S0, int n, double u, double d){
    vector<vector<double>> result;
    result.push_back(vector<double>{S0});
    for(int i=0;i<n;i++){
        vector<double> previous_layer = result[i];
        vector<double> current_layer;
        for(int j=0;j<previous_layer.size();j++){
            if(j==0){
                current_layer.push_back(previous_layer[j]*u);
                current_layer.push_back(previous_layer[j]*d);
            } else {
                current_layer.push_back(previous_layer[j]*d);
            }
        }
        result.push_back(current_layer);
    }

    return result;
}
```

* Once the forward tree is constructed, we calculate the terminal nodes of the backwards tree using the strike price and the terminal values of the stock price. 
* Once the terminal nodes is computed, we compute the value of the risk neutral probability measures p and q to compute the remaining nodes of the tree in backward direction. 
* Here also, the entire tree is saved in `vector<vector<double>>`, and thus, saving all the intermediate values in the tree. 
* The following function computes the backwards tree
```c++
vector<vector<double>> compute_price_backwards(const vector<double>& terminal_layer, int n, double p, double q, double discount_factor) {
    vector<vector<double>> backwards_tree;
    backwards_tree.push_back(terminal_layer);

    for(int i=0;i<n;i++){
        vector<double> previous_layer = backwards_tree[i];
        vector<double> current_layer;
        for(int j=0;j<previous_layer.size()-1; j++){
            double val = discount_factor * (p * previous_layer[j] + q * previous_layer[j+1]);
            current_layer.push_back(val);
        }
        backwards_tree.push_back(current_layer);
    }
    return backwards_tree;
}
```

# Unit Tests
* Online calculator was used to compute the prices of options using black-scholes model.
  * This calculator can be found at https://goodcalculators.com/black-scholes-calculator/
  * These test cases were encoded in a function, which is run at the beginning of the main file.

* One test was also run to regenerate the results from Homework 3 in Stochastic Processes in Finance. 
  * This test can be found in the results snapshot below. 

# Results
* Following snapshot contains the results of the experiment.
